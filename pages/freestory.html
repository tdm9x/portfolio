        <h1>The Athletic Email Copy</h1>
        <p>
            This email copy is for a free article on The Athletic, a subscription-based sports journalism department. 

            I intended to write an appealing introduction to the article by highlighting the success of the NBA's reigning champions as 

            As well as how remarkable their starting record to the season has been, to appeal to basketball fans. I also implemented a strong call-to-action with the 

            subject line, the final sentence, and the button link. For the email design, I used Figma and I created a similar format to The Athletic's

            UI used in their email copies.

        <p>Subject Line: The Thunder is Still Rumbling <br><br>

        December 12, 2025 <br><br>

        After last night’s 49-point win in the Emirates NBA Cup, the league’s 
        reigning champs have improved to 24-1 with their 16th straight win. 
        As they now enter the semifinals, they are also tied with the 15-16 
        Warriors for the best starting record. With one more win, they could 
        be on track to set a new regular-season record of 73-9. Read our recap 
        of their journey to dominance. <br><br>
