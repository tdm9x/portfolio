        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I have never minded the idea of working in this world. 
            I understand that in order to achieve a goal, you must put in the work. 
            So when it came to choosing what field of work to pursue, I knew it had 
            to be something creative.<br><br>

            The first story I wrote was during my sixth-grade Language Arts class. 
            On Fridays, we had a free-writing day. Throughout the year, I wrote a 
            sci-fi adventure that included the characters from the video game <i>Smash Bros. Melee.</i> 
            I never finished it, but I do remember my teacher and friends thinking it was cool. 
            Though my desire to be a writer didn’t bloom until college, it was the start of my 
            current journey.<br><br>

            The beauty of college for a mind like mine is the access to learn even more about 
            topics you’ve always been interested in. Nothing excited me more than having the 
            opportunity to take a class on African American Literature. It was in this class 
            that I met the professor who would inspire me to change from a major in Business 
            to English and pursue creative writing.<br><br>

            These days, I’m a writer focused on producing compelling and persuasive long- and 
            short-form copy while developing my voice in creative writing. I am interested in 
            creating works that accentuate culture, art, and identity and display vivid storytelling 
            for all.<br><br>
            </p>
